# Working With Legacy Ember Objects

When working with the legacy Ember object model, `EmberObject`, there are a number of caveats and limitations you need to be aware of. For today, these caveats and limitations apply to any classes which extend directly from `EmberObject`, or which extend classes which *themselves* extend `EmberObject`:

- `Component` – meaning *classic* Ember components, which imported from `@ember/component`, *not* Glimmer components which are imported from `@glimmer/component` and do *not* extend the `EmberObject` base class.
- `Controller`
- `Helper` – note that this applies only to the *class* form. Function-based helpers do not involve the `EmberObject` base class.
- `Route`
- `Router`
- `Service`
- Ember Data’s `Model` class

Additionally, Ember’s mixin system is deeply linked to the semantics and implementation details of `EmberObject`, *and* it has the most caveats and limitations.

In the future, some of these may be able to drop their `EmberObject` base class dependency, but that will not happen till at least the next major version of Ember, and these guides will be updated when that happens.

## Mixins and classic class syntax

The Ember mixin system is the legacy Ember construct TypeScript supports *least* well.  While this may not be intuitively obvious, the classic class syntax simply *is* the mixin system. Every classic class creation is a case of mixing together multiple objects to create a new base class with a shared prototype. The result is that any time you see the classic `.extend({ ... })` syntax, regardless of whether there is a named mixin involved, you are dealing with Ember's legacy mixin system. This in turn means that you are dealing with the parts of Ember which TypeScript is *least* able to handle well.

While we describe here how to use types with classic (mixin-based) classes insofar as they *do* work, there are many failure modes. As a result, we strongly recommend moving away from both classic classes and mixins, and as quickly as possible. This is the direction the Ember ecosystem as a whole is moving, but it is *especially* important for TypeScript users.

The [Ember Atlas] includes guides for migrating [from classic classes to native classes][classic to native], along with [a variety of patterns][mixin patterns] for dealing with specific kinds of mixins in your codebase.

### Failure modes

::TODO: spell these out/include others:: 

- need to define `this` in actions hashes, CPs, etc.
- …which leads to problems with self-referential `this`
- TS simply fails to resolve types when enough mixins are involved
- Zebra-striping problem: types stop resolving
- ::TODO: others? ::

## Native classes

### `EmberObject`

In general, we recommend (following the Ember Octane guides) that any class which extends directly from the `EmberObject` base class eliminate any use of `EmberObject`-specific API and convert to standalone class, with no base class at all. You can follow the [ember-classic-decorator] workflow to eliminate the base class—switching from `init` to `constructor`, getting rid of uses of methods like `this.set` and `this.get` in favor of using standalone `set` and `get`, and so on.

###  `EmberObject`-descended classes

The framework base classes which depend on `EmberObject` cannot follow the exact same path. However, as long as you are using native class syntax, all of these (`Component`, `Controller`, `Helper`,  etc.) work nicely and safely with TypeScript. In each of these cases, the same caveats apply as with `EmberObject` itself, and you should follow the [ember-classic-decorator] workflow with them as well if you are converting an existing app or addon. However, because these base classes themselves descend from `EmberObject`, you will not be able to remove the base classes as you can with your *own* classes which descend *directly* from `EmberObject`. Instead, you will continue to extend from the Ember base classes:

```ts
import Component from '@ember/component';
export default class Profile extends Component {}
```
```ts
import Controller from '@ember/controller';
export default class IndexController extends Controller {}
```
```ts
import Helper from '@ember/component/helper';
export default class Localize extends Helper {}
```
```ts
import Route from '@ember/routing/route';
export default class ApplicationRoute extends Route {}
```
```ts
import EmberRouter from '@ember/routing/router'
export default class AppRouter extends EmberRouter {}
```
```ts
import Service from '@ember/service';
export default class Session extends Service {}
```
```ts
import Model from '@ember-data/model';
export default class User extends Model {}
```

#### `Service`

Since Ember is largely, and increasingly, a [“component-service framework”], you will find that you regularly need to specify the types of services you inject in other
